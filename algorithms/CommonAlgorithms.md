# Common Algorithms

For some leetcode solutions in Python3, I reconcile them in jupyter notebook (still in progress). Check out my [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/darrenfu/LeetcodePy/tree/master/jupyter-notebook/)

Here lists some common algorithms to deal with classic leetcode problems.

1. Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm  
Use case: Find the majority element in a list of values. Check this [article](https://gregable.com/2013/10/majority-vote-algorithm-find-majority.html).
