# Common Algorithms

We often encounter some algorithms in leetcode problems.

1. Boyer-Moore Majority Vote algorithm  
*Use case*: Find the majority element in a list of values.  
[Great article](https://gregable.com/2013/10/majority-vote-algorithm-find-majority.html) to explain it.  
*Time complexity*: O(N)
