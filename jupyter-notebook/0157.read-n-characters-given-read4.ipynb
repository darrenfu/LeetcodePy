    "### [157\\. Read N Characters Given Read4](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty: **Easy**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method to read _n_ characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method read4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the number of actual characters read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of read4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Parameter:  char[] buf\n",
    "    Returns:    int\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File file(\"abcdefghijk\"); // File is \"abcdefghijk\", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'\n",
    "char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 4\\. Now buf = \"abcd\", fp points to 'e'\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 4\\. Now buf = \"efgh\", fp points to 'i'\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 3\\. Now buf = \"ijk\", fp points to end of file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method read:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `read4` method, implement the method `read` that reads _n_ characters from the file and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the number of actual characters read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of read:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Parameters:\tchar[] buf, int n\n",
    "    Returns:\tint\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: file = \"abc\", n = 4\n",
    "Output: 3\n",
    "Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3\\. Note that \"abc\" is the file's content, not buf. buf is the destination buffer that you will have to write the results to.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: file = \"abcde\", n = 5\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abcde\". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 3:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: file = \"abcdABCD1234\", n = 12\n",
    "Output: 12\n",
    "Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abcdABCD1234\". We read a total of 12 characters from the file, so return 12.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: file = \"leetcode\", n = 5\n",
    "Output: 5\n",
    "Explanation: After calling your read method, buf should contain \"leetc\". We read a total of 5 characters from the file, so return 5.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for `read4` but **not** for `read`.\n",
    "2.  The `read` function will only be called once for each test case.\n",
    "3.  You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing _n_ characters."
