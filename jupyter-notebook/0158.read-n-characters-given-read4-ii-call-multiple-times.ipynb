    "### [158\\. Read N Characters Given Read4 II - Call multiple times](https://leetcode.com/problems/read-n-characters-given-read4-ii-call-multiple-times/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty: **Hard**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method `read4`, implement a method `read` to read _n_ characters. **Your method `read` may be called multiple times.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method read4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The API `read4` reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array `buf`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the number of actual characters read.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `read4()` has its own file pointer, much like `FILE *fp` in C.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of read4:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Parameter:  char[] buf\n",
    "    Returns:    int\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: buf[] is destination not source, the results from read4 will be copied to buf[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a high level example of how `read4` works:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File file(\"abcdefghijk\"); // File is \"abcdefghijk\", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'\n",
    "char[] buf = new char[4]; // Create buffer with enough space to store characters\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 4\\. Now buf = \"abcd\", fp points to 'e'\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 4\\. Now buf = \"efgh\", fp points to 'i'\n",
    "read4(buf); // read4 returns 3\\. Now buf = \"ijk\", fp points to end of file\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Method read:**\n",
    "\n",
    "By using the `read4` method, implement the method `read` that reads _n_ characters from the file and store it in the buffer array `buf`. Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The return value is the number of actual characters read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition of read:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    Parameters:\tchar[] buf, int n\n",
    "    Returns:\tint\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: buf[] is destination not source, you will need to write the results to buf[]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File file(\"abc\");\n",
    "Solution sol;\n",
    "// Assume buf is allocated and guaranteed to have enough space for storing all characters from the file.\n",
    "sol.read(buf, 1); // After calling your read method, buf should contain \"a\". We read a total of 1 character from the file, so return 1.\n",
    "sol.read(buf, 2); // Now buf should contain \"bc\". We read a total of 2 characters from the file, so return 2.\n",
    "sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "File file(\"abc\");\n",
    "Solution sol;\n",
    "sol.read(buf, 4); // After calling your read method, buf should contain \"abc\". We read a total of 3 characters from the file, so return 3.\n",
    "sol.read(buf, 1); // We have reached the end of file, no more characters can be read. So return 0.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Consider that you **cannot** manipulate the file directly, the file is only accesible for `read4` but **not** for `read`.\n",
    "2.  The `read` function may be called **multiple times**.\n",
    "3.  Please remember to **RESET** your class variables declared in Solution, as static/class variables are **persisted across multiple test cases**. Please see for more details.\n",
    "4.  You may assume the destination buffer array, `buf`, is guaranteed to have enough space for storing _n_ characters.\n",
    "5.  It is guaranteed that in a given test case the same buffer `buf` is called by `read`."
