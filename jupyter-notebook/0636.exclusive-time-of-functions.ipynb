    "### [636\\. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Difficulty: **Medium**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "On a **single threaded** CPU, we execute some functions.  Each function has a unique id between `0` and `N-1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We store logs in timestamp order that describe when a function is entered or exited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each log is a string with this format: `\"{function_id}:{\"start\" | \"end\"}:{timestamp}\"`.  For example, `\"0:start:3\"` means the function with id `0` **started at the beginning** of timestamp `3`.  `\"1:end:2\"` means the function with id `1` **ended at the end** of timestamp `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function's _exclusive time_ is the number of units of time spent in this function.  Note that this does **not** include any recursive calls to child functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU is **single threaded** which means that only one function is being executed at a given time unit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the exclusive time of each function, sorted by their function id.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**![](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/04/05/diag1b.png)**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input:\n",
    "n = 2\n",
    "logs = [\"0:start:0\",\"1:start:2\",\"1:end:5\",\"0:end:6\"]\n",
    "Output: [3, 4]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "Function 0 starts at the beginning of time 0, then it executes 2 units of time and reaches the end of time 1.\n",
    "Now function 1 starts at the beginning of time 2, executes 4 units of time and ends at time 5.\n",
    "Function 0 is running again at the beginning of time 6, and also ends at the end of time 6, thus executing for 1 unit of time. \n",
    "So function 0 spends 2 + 1 = 3 units of total time executing, and function 1 spends 4 units of total time executing.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  `1 <= n <= 100`\n",
    "2.  Two functions won't start or end at the same time.\n",
    "3.  Functions will always log when they exit."
