    "In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.  If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, say our starting node is _eventually safe _if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.  More specifically, there exists a natural number `K` so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than `K` steps.\n",

    "Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.\n",
    "\n",
    "The directed graph has `N` nodes with labels `0, 1, ..., N-1`, where `N` is the length of `graph`.  The graph is given in the following form: `graph[i]` is a list of labels `j` such that `(i, j)` is a directed edge of the graph.\n",
