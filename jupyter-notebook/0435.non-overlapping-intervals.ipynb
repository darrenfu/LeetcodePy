    "Given a collection of intervals, find the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]\n",
    "Output: 1\n",
    "Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of intervals are non-overlapping.\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]\n",
    "Output: 2\n",
    "Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of intervals non-overlapping.\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: [[1,2],[2,3]]\n",
    "Output: 0\n",
    "Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  You may assume the interval's end point is always bigger than its start point.\n",
    "2.  Intervals like [1,2] and [2,3] have borders \"touching\" but they don't overlap each other."
